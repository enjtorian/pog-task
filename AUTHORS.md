### Contributions
- **Framework Conception & Theory**: Identified the critical gap in AI execution where instructions remain invisible, and defined the "POG Task" structural unit to bridge this divide.
- **Pattern Naming**: Formalized the shift from ephemeral chat-based prompts to binding, auditable contracts, elevating AI behavior to a first-class artifact.
- **Documentation & Architecture**: Complete whitepaper authorship, rigorous system design, and implementation guides.

### Background
As a software systems architect with over 20 years of experience, I had a front-row seat to how teams organize their work. When LLM-powered coding tools emerged, I noticed a recurring pattern: colleagues were achieving remarkable things with prompts, but those instructions remained invisible, undocumented, and unrepeated—buried in ephemeral chat logs.

**Behind the immense execution power of LLMs, a critical gap became evident:** we granted AI the agency to modify systems, yet lacked a structural unit, like a Git Commit, to define the boundaries of behavior.

This framework is not an invention; it is an attempt to name a missing, overdue structural layer. POG Task acknowledges AI as a legitimate workforce and elevates its behavior to the status of a formal artifact—transforming AI work from transient notes into binding contracts.

The patterns described here were already happening independently across teams; they just needed a name. By making these invisible assets visible and governed, we accelerate the conversation about responsible AI execution.
